  - text: "The ятга or Yatga from Mongolia would be a fascinating instrument to dive into. Modern musicians have adopted the 21-string, s-bridge guzheng as the template for their music. Sources are scarce but I found one [yatga mention here](http://cultures5.blogspot.com/2012/01/traditional-popular-music-quotes_6880.html). Paraphrased:\n\n> The most commonly contemporary yatga is the twenty-one-stringed \"Master Yatga.\" The length of full-size instrument 1.62m or 63 inches. There is also the 13-string version called \"Gariin Yatga\".\r\n>\n> Historical versions played in the Mongolian palace had 12 strings, one for each of the the twelve levels of the palace hierarchy. Common people preferred a 10-stringed version. The Epic of Jangar, a massive work written by people of the region, involves a young princess and an 800-string yatga with 82 bridges.\n\nFor a wonderful photo I don't have license to, please check out renowned photographer Tom Kelly's Photos from the [2016 Nadaam Festival](https://www.thomaslkellyphotos.com/STOCK/MONGOLIA/MONGOLIA-2016/i-gzfgBTT/A)."
