    text: "Do not think that how things are now is how they ever were. Instruments change with time. Millions of people have experimented with different musical ideas and shapes over humanity’s history. Here are some examples of those varieties.\n\nHere's a treat. It comes to us from a[ MIMO entry from the Musée Du Palais Lascaris](http://www.mimo-international.com/MIMO/doc/IFD/OAI_CIMU_ALOES_0864140).\n\n\r\n\nMy French is terrible, but I discern it mentions 26 strings wound around 13 posts, possibly doubling back on themselves. It comes from 1800s China. \r\n\n\r\n\nTapping into my knowledge of physics I'm guessing the posts by the fixed bridge are an anchor, the diagonal line of posts keep the string off the soundboard, and the line of posts at the top are the tuning pegs, possibly hand-wound based on the spacing and how they seem to taper flat, like the pin second from the right. But that's just a theory! It's 93cm/ ~36 inches long so a great deal shorter than mainstream zhengs.\r\n\n\r\n\nAs for the doubling back, perhaps the were looking for an effect similar to today's 12-string guitars? Or perhaps it's supposed to be struck like a hammer dulcimer."

    text: "Here's a strange one. This was taken at the Museum für Musikinstrumente der Universität Leipzig, in Leipzig, Germany. It appears to have 9 strings tied in the fashion of a koto. That is, the strings are left long and bundled on the tail, typically in loops. The tail is on the right side. The instrument is standing on its head, though I've rotated it here. The extra length of string is now hanging down the instrument.\r\n\n\r\n\nKoto strings were left long to deal with silk strings breaking frequently. Since they'd usually break where they were played, by the head, you could pull the string towards the head until the break was even with your tying point, and tie it off again. \r\n\n\r\n\nBecause of that extra length and tie pattern I'll suggest the strings are silk. I don't know why else they would have so much extra. As to date made or country of origin, I haven't the slightest idea. The significant curvature suggests it could have been played with a bow either laying flat or standing vertically on a surface."
