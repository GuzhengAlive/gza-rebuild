      The ятга or Yatga from Mongolia would be a fascinating instrument to dive
      into. Modern musicians have adopted the 21-string, s-bridge guzheng as the
      template for their music. Sources are scarce but I found one [yatga
      mention
      here](http://cultures5.blogspot.com/2012/01/traditional-popular-music-quotes_6880.html).
      Paraphrased:


      > The most commonly contemporary yatga is the twenty-one-stringed "Master
      Yatga." The length of full-size instrument 1.62m or 63 inches. There is
      also the 13-string version called "Gariin Yatga".

      >

      > Historical versions played in the Mongolian palace had 12 strings, one
      for each of the the twelve levels of the palace hierarchy. Common people
      preferred a 10-stringed version. The Epic of Jangar, a massive work
      written by people of the region, involves a young princess and an
      800-string yatga with 82 bridges.


      For a wonderful photo I don't have license to, please check out renowned
      photographer Tom Kelly's Photos from the [2016 Nadaam
      Festival](https://www.thomaslkellyphotos.com/STOCK/MONGOLIA/MONGOLIA-2016/i-gzfgBTT/A).


      Various photographs show some players on thin, 13-string long zithers that
      look quite similar to the Korean Gayageum. I unfortunatley don't know more
      other than to say it could be something like this [Mongolian Store's
