  - text: "The guzheng is frustratingly hard to learn about if you only speak English. Most English web results are copies of older versions of English Wikipedia's article, are promotional in nature, or are so specific they leave out great information. Non-web sources are frustratingly superficial, a challenge to find, and/or confounded by translation and language issues.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe shining exception to this problem is the best English-Language resource that is freely available: \"T[he emergence of the Chinese zheng : traditional context, contemporary evolution, and cultural identity](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0073945)\" a PhD thesis by Dr. Mei Han written in 2013 for the University of British Columbia. The author, Dr. Han (韓梅) ([personal site](http://www.mei-han.com/meihan.html)) is an accomplished performer, skilled researcher, and certainly not the least importantly for the sake of this project, fluent in both English and Chinese. Her thesis is based on her original research, interviews with informed people in the zheng world, and her translations from Chinese-language sources. Her expertise has been recognized by the editors of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians who asked her to write the entry on the guzheng. Dr. Han is the gold standard for English-Language guzheng resources."
  - heading: Influence and Influencers
    text: "Before we get into some summaries, check out how some of these sources have impacted each other over time. Some bodies of work are cited by almost everyone: Tsai-Ping Liang, Cao Zheng, and Te-Yuan Cheng have bodies of work that appear in most every source I reference. Their perspectives continue to have direct and indirect influence on how we think and talk about the instrument today.\r\n\n\r\n\nOthers such as my beloved Ferguson, Kwok, and Kao have not been cited by the later works I've so far compiled. While they each have their own contributions I don't believe they have been assimilated into the general body of guzheng knowledge.\r\n\n\r\n\nChen, Cheng, and Han, on the other hand, continue to influence today's understandings. While this diagram ends with Han 2013, her paper's statistics show 3300 downloads since publication with 2000 downloads heading to Beijing in 2016 and 2017. That suggests her work is being actively considered. \r\n\n\r\n\nI made this chart to help us keep in mind: If all the sources cite the works of Te-Yuan Cheng, how much of those later works are repeating his conclusions and how much are they challenging and enhancing? It would be wonderful to make a diagram with the many, many non-English sources but current logistics prevent me from doing so. Email me if you are up to the challenge.  \r\n\n\r\n\nOn to the Sources!\n\nBelow are noteworthy sources I've read and summarized. Researched sources you can view online, printed sources you have to buy or borrow, and websites are sorted out. Citations for these and all other sources are available on the Bibliography and Further Reading pages."

        description: >-
          An accessible introduction to the topic and the first I read, Gaywood
          is unfortunately plagued with issues. Its limited array of citations
          suggests uneven coverage of the topic, its coverage of both the qin
          and guzheng lead to some confusion, it summarizes to the point of
          missing information, and some statements on times and locations appear
          incorrect when compared to other sources. Finally, its use of
          hand-written Chinese characters rather than typed ones makes it harder
          to cross reference translations and sources. We can only do our best
          with what we have, but in this case I'm afraid the restrictions proved
          too much.
