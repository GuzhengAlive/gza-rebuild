  _Sound of China Guzheng Basic Tutorial_ is an English-language book written by
  Carol Chang, owner and operator of Sound of China and ChineseZither.net. It is
  a frank overview of what you need to get started learning the guzheng. There
  is no fluff, no romanticism, and very little cultural context - just the
  straightforward basics. It’s intended for absolute beginners, providing
  everything you need to get started and using an instructional style that
  spaces out lessons and practices between greater challenges. This review is
  based on the edition that ChineseZither.net distributes online as part of
  their Resources section. I have not listened to the CDs but if you include
  them with the listed purchase price of $19.50 it is well worth it.
