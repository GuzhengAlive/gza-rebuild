          By contrast, here is a video of the more common, assembly-by-parts
          method. Some of the methods are cheap and fast and donâ€™t lead to the
          best sound - but put that aside and this video provides a great visual
          way to see the process for yourself. Read on for more details.

    text: "Guzheng are assembled from shaped pieces of wood that have been cut, dried, and heat-treated to enhance their visual and acoustic beauty. Typically the soundboard and backboard are shaped from various woods, the frame of the instrument is built in steps, and then the overall instrument is assembled. This enables the guzheng makers to balance sound quality, looks, and overall expense at different levels for different musicians.\r\n\n\r\n\nSome instrument makers like Mitsuya Koto hollow out a log to create the guzheng, frame and all. That is a work-intensive process so they produce only high-end instruments from traditionally-aged wood. They have an excellent photo overview and video showing some of the steps:"

    text: "Approximate dimensions of one Dunhuang-style S-Bridge 21-string guzheng are:\r\n\n\r\n\nLength 164.5cm (64 3/4 in.)\r\n\n\r\n\nWidth 32.4 cm (12 3/4 in.)\r\n\n\r\n\nHeight 24.1 cm (9.5 in. including bridges)\r\n\n\r\n\nInstruments vary by model and maker. Instrument makers change the dimensions to balance the overall size of the instrument, the tensions this will require for the strings, the volume of the resonance chamber, and the thickness of the soundboard itself."

          measurement ranges. A and C have the sharpest horizontal curvature; A
          and B have the sharper vertical/longitudinal curvature. Lengths are
          approximate; they vary maker to maker. Model by author.

        subsectiontext: "It's important to remember that the soundboard is the center of the instrument. The head, tail, and frame add additional width, height, and length.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe dimensions of each soundboard depend on a  number of things. Thickness varies based on the density of the wood used. Denser woods can be cut thinner than 9mm. Less dense woods are cut thicker. And as if all that wasn't enough, the soundboard in the top quality instruments is tapered, leaving it thicker underneath the bass strings and thinner underneath the treble strings. Carol Chang mentions a change in thickness of about +/- 1mm from the average - so a soundboard with a thickness of 9mm in the midrange might have a thickness of 8mm under the treble and 10mm under the bass."

          The radii of curvature balance a few considerations. Curving the
          soundboard sets one boundary on the size of the resonance chamber
          inside the instrument, and I believe enhances the sound produced.
          Making the radii too small and thus the curves more severe can cause
          filaments of wood to separate from each other. Those filaments will
          then vibrate separately from the rest of the instrument decreasing the
          quality of the sound. 


          Some instrument makers carve sound grooves into the underside of the
          soundboard. They do this either by hand or through a mechanized
          process. Mitsuya Koto carves them by hand. I don't have too many
          sources on the consequences of sound grooves but I've heard it
          mentioned it makes the instrument louder. If you know of reasons,
          please, send them in!

    text: "Most guzheng soundboards are made from quartersawn planks of Paulownia. Read more about Paulownia and other options on the [Woods ](/guzheng-woods)page. To quartersaw a log is to cut the log into planks as in this diagram. The log is marked or cut into quarters, then the quarters are cut at 45 degree angles to the center. This maximize the amount of plank with grain patterns that are as close to straight as possible. Straight grains mean the wood is stronger and generally has more desirable characteristics.\r\n\n\r\n\nAs the planks get smaller the angle between the centerline of the board and the curve of the grain or growth ring gets farther away from perpendicular, which is farther away from that nice, straight grain. Those smaller planks can be spliced together to form a full board, but the sound they produce will be a little different. There are other ways to cut planks so that each is a large size and has nearly straight grains such as rift cutting, but that wastes a lot of wood. You can see a diagram at [Hardwood Distributors.org](http://www.hardwooddistributors.org/blog/postings/what-is-rift-sawn-lumber/).\r\n\n\r\n\nThe wood is then dried, a process also called seasoning in English. There are a few ways to do it, it's fascinating stuff! Head over to the [Wood Drying](/notes-on-wood-drying) page to learn more about those details. In brief: wood shrinks as it dries and will crack if it shrinks after it's part of an instrument. To prevent that cracking wood is dried and shrunk first and then turned into an instrument. There are different ways to do it but the end goal is the same: to get wood that is a stable size, sounds good, and will continue to sound good for years to come.\r\n\n\r\n\nOnce you have one such plank you have to shape it. Each plank is curved in two directions: Horizontally, along the width of the plank, and vertically, along the length of the plank. Cheng 1991 says curved soundboards used to be carved out of large blocks of wood. This provided exceptional sound but wasted wood. Nowadays boards are cut to a desired thickness, soaked, and then pressed into the desired curvature. A heat treatment step locks that curve into place. Cheng quotes the following numbers: Final board thicknesses are around 9mm. The horizontal radius of curvature ranges from 36cm to 45cm. The vertical or longitudinal radius of curvature ranges from 450cm to 860cm.\r\n\n\r\n\nThose radii of curvature may seem crazy, but plugging them in you get a reasonable board:"
  - heading: Backboard
    text: "The Soundboard is the curved board on the front. The Backboard is the board in the back. Older zhengs and zithers had flat backboards. During the instrument reforms of the 1950s the instrument makers found it necessary to curve backboards convex up, approximating the curve of the soundboard. They do this to limit the size of the resonance cavity. That big open space in the center of the guzheng helps amplify the sound of the plucked strings while adjusting the overall quality and characteristics of the sounds the instrument produces. As one reference relates: \"The approximate resonant pitch of the air chamber is important to the sound, determining as it does which frequency ranges will be enriched. That resonance is jointly determined... by the volume of the chamber and the size of the \\[sound holes].\" (\"[Musical Instrument Design: Practical Information for Instrument Making](https://books.google.com/books?id=zQECBAAAQBAJ&q=The+approximate+resonant+pitch#v=snippet&q=%22The%20approximate%20resonant%20pitch%22&f=false)\" by Bart Hopkin, 1996).\r\n\n\r\n\nAside from being curved, the backboard is the place where the sound holes are carved. These are needed for the amplified sound of the strings to escape and reach the audience. The shape or total surface area of the sound holes affect the pitch range the chamber resonates with and how it does so. I don't have many sources on instruments with resonance chambers or sound holes as large as the guzheng. Placement, shape, size, and total surface area of the combined holes could have different effects. Then again, perhaps after a certain point size doesn't matter. All I can say is that zhengs have had different sizes, shapes, and placements of sound holes throughout history and continue to do so today."
