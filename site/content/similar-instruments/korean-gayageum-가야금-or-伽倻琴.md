    text: "The Korean Gayageum (가야금 or 伽倻琴) was an originally 12 string zither from the peninsula. A history written in 1145 CE says that the first gayageum was made sometime between 500 and 562 CE in the Gaya Confederacy, a region in Korea. The instrument came about when a king saw a Chinese zither and ordered a similar instrument to be made. The gayageum is not a direct descendant of the zheng. Inspired by, adapted from perhaps, but a wholly Korean creation.\r\n\n\r\n\nJust like the zheng, gayageum have changed over time. Famous variants include the Sanjo, Pungryu, Beopgeum, and Jeongak. String counts have varied from 12-25 strings as we see in this picture. #4 is a 25-string gayageum, while #1 and #3 have 12 strings. Hints that a zither is a gayageum include the T-shape of the bridges and the tied ropes at the end.\r\n\n\r\n\nModern times has seen an extra wrinkle - Korean players appropriating the Dunhuang-style guzheng and rechristening it a gayageum. Oh for globalization!\r\n\n\r\n\nThe site this picture comes from, the [Korean Cultural Heritage Foundation](http://www.chf.or.kr/c2/sub1.jsp?thisPage=3&searchField=title&searchText=&brdType=R&bbIdx=100306), and a few other sources agree to the origin in the 6th century CE, but beyond that I can't say much. If you know more, send me an email!"
