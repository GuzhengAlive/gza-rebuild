This first image is a Japanese Koto from the 1800s (箏, こと, or alternatively 琴) photographed by the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts. The instrument traces its lineage back to China's Tang Dynasty when 13-string zheng were first brought to Japan. Their design has remained largely unchanged across time.



Big differences between the koto and a zheng are: Overall dimensions, string material and tying, and the tuning system. Kotos tend to be longer and thinner, though variants can certainly change this. Their strings used to be silk, with long loops of excess string left on the instrument to allow for retying when the strings break. Modern koto use a synthetic string made of either nylon or polyester; there is some confusion on its material composition in English sources. The modern tuning system is commonly held in the end cap like a zheng but is not enclosed in a box. See the second picture for an example.



Variants have been introduced with different string counts and lengths such as the 17-string koto, but whereas different instruments vied for popularity in China, in Japan they were accepted alongside the original 13-string instrument. The larger morphology remains steady. The one exception to this is the incredible 80-string variant made by Mitsuya Koto for Miyagi Michio, a renowned koto player:
