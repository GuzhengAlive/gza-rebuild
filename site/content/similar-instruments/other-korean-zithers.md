      Korea has a rich history experimenting with and constructing zithers.
      About 2 years after I wrote the following I found more information about
      this zither... but have misplaced it. I'll have to try and find it. In the
      mean time, enjoy my confusion.


      From 2017: "Leipzig has this [10-bridge
      instrument](http://www.mimo-international.com/MIMO/doc/IFD/OAI_ULEI_M0003969)
      where each bridge supports 2 strings. That sounds more like a hammered
      dulcimer BUT a double-strung 9-bridge instrument that uses a bow exists
      elsewhere that [museum staff name a
      Laqin](http://educators.mfa.org/musical-instruments/zither-laqin-30234).
      So what is this?"

    text: "Here's another blast from the past. I was so mystified by this when I first found it! It turns out that Korean artisans made many different types of zither, many of which are still played. At some point I hope to write more about these, but for now enjoy my confusion from 2017:\n\nFrom the University of Leipzig we have, translated and paraphrased from the [German record on MIMO](http://www.mimo-db.eu/MIMO/infodoc/ged/view.aspx?eid=OAI_ULEI_M0003970):\r\n\n\r\n\nThey say this is a 12-string zither made in Korea between 1900 and 1950. Its wooden body consists of a resonating soundboard, floor and frame. The soundboard is evenly arched. The 12 movable bridges are 6 of brighter and 6 of darker wood. The strings are wound copper and steel. There is a rectangular sound hole in the back. Tuning pegs are hidden under one of the sides.\r\n\n\r\n\nIt's 83.2cm or ~32 inches long, so far shorter than modern incarnations of other long zithers from east Asia. It could be a shortened version of a Korean Gayageum but it is using Chinese-style bridges. \r\n\n\r\n\nSimilarly a typical Koto, the Japanese long zither, is around 190cm, [like this one at a US Museum](http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/zither-koto-446207). But that same museum has a [miniaturized version](http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/miniature-zither-koto-50712) that is just as old and comes in at 53.8cm. Perhaps this is a miniaturized Gayageum then?"
