      Guzheng music has evolved so much over the centuries. Players have been
      making music for thousands of years, but if you head out into the world
      today you are likely to encounter music of a few distinct categories.

      First up, music that roughly fits in the world of "Traditional". Here are
      two examples of famous, well known songs as interpreted by the fantastic
      Wáng Zhōngshān.

      "Battling the Typhoon" is one particularly famous song. It was premiered
      in the tumultuous 1970s amid the musical reorganization in China, gaining
      popularity and cementing the guzheng's future by demonstrating the
      instrument's range and power.

      Where originally the guzheng was part of an ensemble, one of many
      instruments, its rising popularity led to an increase in guzheng-only
      groups who split different sections of songs between them - melodies and
      solos, as well as high or low parts were mixed together to create
      impressive experiences.

      Music continued to evolve and musicians continued to experiment. The last
      few decades have been no different; entirely new forms of music are being
      tested and tried, either with just the instrument or alongside more modern
      instruments (or backing tracks).
