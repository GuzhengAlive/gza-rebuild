Ask a question! Offer a thought! Share a story!

[Send an Email!](#sendemail)

To truly tell the stories of the guzheng I need the community's help. If you have history, experiences, or new sources to send me please get in touch. There's a form at the bottom of every page you can use to send me an email. Even if you have only your own experiences and a few moments to share your story, please, please do so! I would be happy to speak with you. Together, through our shared voices, we can make something wonderful.



And of course, if you have questions or are looking to get in touch with the experts I cite, send an email and I will do what I can.
