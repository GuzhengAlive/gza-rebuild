    text: "The Chinese Se is an instrument that possibly predates the guzheng and qin - or maybe is descended from a common ancestor. Regardless of the specifics, the Se was once an important and well-regarded instrument.\n\nIt faded in popularity as the qin and zheng gained prominence. It is my personal conjecture that the se's size led to its demise. The one above is 7 feet 6 inches long (2.24m). When an instrument is too big and expensive it will eventually fade out, regardless of how beautiful its sound. For a comparison: the western concert harp is a hauntingly beautiful instrument that most everyone agrees is worth listening to. It's also massive. Tell me, how many concert harpists do you know? And how much money do they have? If you answer \"very few\" and \"more than enough\" you've made my point.\n\nThe West's support of symphonies and orchestras give a small number of concert harpists enough money to learn, purchase, and maintain harps. In China, the equivalent were the palace courts which kept the se alive. When tastes changed the se faded away. But some remain!\n\nThe instrument above comes to us from the collections of the [Museum of Fine Arts](http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/zither-se-50604) in Boston, MA, USA.\r\n\nBelieved to have been constructed in the 1800s it was purchased in 1916. I count 24 strings which is one less than I expected, but maybe one is hidden. It comes in at a whopping 223.8cm or 88in long. It's far bigger than most other zithers. Notice how it slants down at the tail. You'll see that in the Japanese Koto, suggesting this was inspired or connected to the designs of zithers in the Tang dynasty which is when the Koto made its way to Japan."

    text: "Here we have another take on the Se, this time from The Met in New York, NY USA.\r\n\nIt's a bit shorter than the MFA Se, coming in at ~183cm or 72 inches, also dated to the 1800s, and also seems to have 24 strings, or 24 bridges, at least. This particular one was taken from a Taoist (Daoist) temple and is inscribed as being made by one Fanfu Lou and owned by the monk Xinzhu. Work by Cheng in his 1991 thesis suggests this was made in the Qing style of zither which was notable for its significant downward angle at one end. That angle _might_ have been used to help position the se in a proper playing stance, but that's just a guess.\n\nAs you look across these se you'll notice how much variety there is. We see the same trend in guzheng. Instruments can be made in a variety of wonderful ways."

      Take a look at this Se!


      The level of ornamentation on this is really fun. That's not as common on
      modern instruments because weighty decorations can reduce the quality of
      the sound of the instrument especially when placed on the soundboard. You
      need that wood to really vibrate, and any paint, inlays, or carvings will
      dampen or distort the sound. I'd guess this was constructed more as a work
      of art and less for its sound but I could be wrong!


      This one has 25 strings and was on display at the Musical Instruments
      Museum in Brussels, Belgium.

      Just like guzheng se varied depending on when and where they were made.
      This is a modern take on an older style of Se, as indicated by the knobs
      on the left of the instrument. This one was photographed in 2012 at the
      China Music trade show / expo in Shanghai. The text on the card translates
      to "18-string ancient se".

      The last se I'll leave you with is this one - a very hard to find
      photograph of what is purported to be a 50-string Sè created for the
      Datong musical group that was active in 1930's Shanghai. I have yet to
      find confirmation from any sources but it could very well be real. Larger
      zithers have been made.
