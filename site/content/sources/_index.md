  - text: "The guzheng is frustratingly hard to learn about if you only speak English. Most English web results are copies of older versions of English Wikipedia's article, are promotional in nature, or are so specific they leave out great information. Non-web sources are frustratingly superficial, a challenge to find, and/or confounded by translation and language issues.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe shining exception to this problem is the best English-Language resource that is freely available: \"T[he emergence of the Chinese zheng : traditional context, contemporary evolution, and cultural identity](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0073945)\" a PhD thesis by Dr. Mei Han written in 2013 for the University of British Columbia. The author, Dr. Han (韓梅) ([personal site](http://www.mei-han.com/meihan.html)) is an accomplished performer, skilled researcher, and certainly not the least importantly for the sake of this project, fluent in both English and Chinese. Her thesis is based on her original research, interviews with informed people in the zheng world, and her translations from Chinese-language sources. Her expertise has been recognized by the editors of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians who asked her to write the entry on the guzheng. Dr. Han is the gold standard for English-Language guzheng resources."

      Before we get into some summaries, check out how some of these sources
      have impacted each other over time. Some bodies of work are cited by
      almost everyone: Tsai-Ping Liang, Cao Zheng, and Te-Yuan Cheng have bodies
      of work that appear in most every source I reference. Their perspectives
      continue to have direct and indirect influence on how we think and talk
      about the instrument today.


      ![Interconnections of sources](/img/interconnectedness-diagram.jpg
      "Interconnections of sources")


      Others such as my beloved Ferguson, Kwok, and Kao have not been cited by
      the later works I've so far compiled. While they each have their own
      contributions I don't believe they have been assimilated into the general
      body of guzheng knowledge.


      Chen, Cheng, and Han, on the other hand, continue to influence today's
      understandings. While this diagram ends with Han 2013, her paper's
      statistics show 3300 downloads since publication with 2000 downloads
      heading to Beijing in 2016 and 2017. That suggests her work is being
      actively considered. 


      I made this chart to help us keep in mind: If all the sources cite the
      works of Te-Yuan Cheng, how much of those later works are repeating his
      conclusions and how much are they challenging and enhancing? It would be
      wonderful to make a diagram with the many, many non-English sources but
      current logistics prevent me from doing so. Email me if you are up to the
      challenge.  


      On to the Sources!


      Below are noteworthy sources I've read and summarized. Researched sources
      you can view online, printed sources you have to buy or borrow, and
      websites are sorted out. Citations for these and all other sources are
      available on the Bibliography and Further Reading pages.

        description: >-
          An accessible introduction to the topic and the first I read, Gaywood
          is unfortunately plagued with issues. Its limited array of citations
          suggests uneven coverage of the topic, its coverage of both the qin
          and guzheng lead to some confusion, it summarizes to the point of
          missing information, and some statements on times and locations appear
          incorrect when compared to other sources. Finally, its use of
          hand-written Chinese characters rather than typed ones makes it harder
          to cross reference translations and sources. We can only do our best
          with what we have, but in this case I'm afraid the restrictions proved
          too much.

          The single best, most comprehensive free source on history and
          development of the guzheng. If you can bring yourself to read no
          others, read this. The only drawback is the file embedded Chinese
          characters with a font rather than using unicode, so Chinese text
          can't be copied for quick lookup, translation, and pronunciation. But!
          That's a small complaint arrayed against the massive undertaking and
          depth of information. This expands upon and generally eclipses her
          earlier Master's thesis, "Historical and Contemporary Development of
          the Chinese Zheng", 2001, University of British Columbia.

          Individual disks (~400MB each) can be downloaded as zip files and
          contain pdf files of issues. The software offers extra search
          capabilities. It's work like this that allows people to learn about
          the world in ways they couldn't otherwise. The Internet Archive
          estimates that the vast majority of the 20th century's books are NOT
          online. As print materials become harder and harder to access,
          projects like this one become harder to accomplish. I hope more
          organizations and individuals invest the effort to digitize and index
          old records.

        description: "A fantastic read. The now Dr. Ferguson goes into depth discussing the history and morphological changes of the instrument before getting super detailed into fingering techniques. It contains what remains the most comprehensive collection and description of fingering techniques as I have yet encountered. Kao 2003 is a close second in this regard.\r\n\n\"Cheng\" is not a typo; Ferguson uses the Yale Romanization system, which has since been eclipsed by Pinyin. Out of print; you must visit one of the three university libraries or request it."

          by Deyuan Zheng (Or Te-yuan Cheng), PhD Dissertation for the
          University of Maryland
        description: "An incredible work. It vies with Mei Han's 2013 dissertation for title of \"best\" resource save for a few issues. First the great:  A clear timeline of changes to the instrument paired with diagrams and photographs of past instruments that I have not seen anywhere else blew me away. Then Cheng gets into the actual construction and physical-acoustic function of the instrument and I was smitten. \r\n\nThere are a few issues. First, the thesis is hard to find. No slight on the author, just unfortunate circumstances. I know of only 13 copies around the world. Second, there are almost no Chinese characters in the work which makes cross referencing information difficult, especially as Cheng chose to use multiple forms of romanization when relating Chinese names and terms. Third, Chinese sources are shown only with translated english titles making them very difficult to look up. \r\n\n\r\n\nIn terms of content there are two major issues: One, little acknowledgement is given to the idea reported in other sources that \"zheng\" was a term used for multiple instruments. This raises concerns about the clarity with which Cheng relates the instrument's history. Is he oversimplifying or does he have firmer sources than others? Two, his description of the interruption of  musical education and how it disrupted and redefined what was 'traditional' was off-puttingly positive. Unknown amounts of information was lost. I would have expected some recognition of that fact. \r\n\nAll that said: This is a must read if you can get your hands on a copy. The title links to the World Cat listing so you can see where your nearest library copy is."
