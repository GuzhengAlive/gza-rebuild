          By contrast, here is a video of the more common, assembly-by-parts
          method. Some of the methods are cheap and fast and donâ€™t lead to the
          best sound - but put that aside and this video provides a great visual
          way to see the process for yourself. Read on for more details.

    text: "Guzheng are assembled from shaped pieces of wood that have been cut, dried, and heat-treated to enhance their visual and acoustic beauty. Typically the soundboard and backboard are shaped from various woods, the frame of the instrument is built in steps, and then the overall instrument is assembled. This enables the guzheng makers to balance sound quality, looks, and overall expense at different levels for different musicians.\r\n\n\r\n\nSome instrument makers like Mitsuya Koto hollow out a log to create the guzheng, frame and all. That is a work-intensive process so they produce only high-end instruments from traditionally-aged wood. They have an excellent photo overview and video showing some of the steps:"
