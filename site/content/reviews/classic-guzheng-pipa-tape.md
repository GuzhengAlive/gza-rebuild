  cloth-backed multi-use tape. It comes in many colors and different lengths.
  The width is usually 10mm or 0.4 inches. This is the standard for adhesive
  finger pick tapes and is so mass produced you can find it on most every online
  retailer around the world.  Brands are not usually advertised, itâ€™s all just
  tape. a single roll will cost between $1-2 and will typically last you 1-2
  months depending on how often you cut new sections and how long you cut them.
  Two months of daily practice is about when you will run out.
