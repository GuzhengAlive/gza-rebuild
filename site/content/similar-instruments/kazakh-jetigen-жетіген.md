      The жетіген from Kazakhstan, anglicized Jetigen, is another in the wide
      family of Asian long zithers. Its music has its own qualities and is
      similarly beautiful. Below are two examples of the music. Information in
      English is incredibly scarce, so we have to rely on machine translations.
      From those are mentions of an original 7-string version, a later 13-string
      version, and subsequent expansions beyond that to 14, 21, and 23-string
      instruments.


      The [Russian
      Wikipedia](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%96%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%BD#%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B0_%D0%BE_%D0%B6%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B5)
      has this telling of the legend of the Jetigen (paraphrased by JB):


      > In ancient times, an old man lived in one \[home]. He had seven sons.
      Once, in the cold winter due to jute (a massive cattle mortality caused by
      icing of pastures or heavy snow making it difficult to graze cattle),
      people were left without food, and grief settled in the old man's house.
      Death claimed all the sons one by one. 

      >

      > After the death of the eldest son of Kania, the heartbroken old man
      hollowed out a piece of withered tree, pulled a string on it and placed a
      bridge under it, and sang “ Karayim ” (“My Dear”).

      >

      > After the death of his second son Torealym, the old father placed a
      second string and improvised “Canat sygar” (“Broken Wing”). For his third
      son Zhaykeldy he composed “Umarym" ("My favorite"); for his fourth, Beken,
      he dedicated “From sөner” (“Extinguished Flame”).

      >

      > When his fifth son Khauas died he composed “Baқyt қoshty” (“Lost
      happiness”). Upon the death of his sixth son Zhulzar he created “үn
      ttyldy” (“Eclipsing Sun”). After the loss of his last and youngest son,
      Kiyas, the old man pulled the seventh string across his board and
      performed “Zheti balamnan ayrylyp құsa boldy” (“Woe from the loss of seven
      sons”). 

      >

      > His songs pulled the sounds of sorrow from his instrument, conjuring
      images of his children. These impromptu melodies were further developed
      and came to us in the form of instrumental pieces under the general title
      "Zhetygennің zhetyuі" ("Seven kyuev zhetygen").
