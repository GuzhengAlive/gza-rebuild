  Ordering everything online can be annoying; it’'d be nice to go to a local
  store and just buy what you need. There are no Asian music supply stores in
  the area so I tried a generic Waterproof Adhesive Tape from a drug store. The
  adhesive is weak, the backing is stiff, which makes basic techniques more
  difficult. After a week of use I would not  recommend it for guzheng use.

      It's a 0.5 inch -wide medical tape with serrated edges for easy tearing.
      That serration is a cool idea but the backing is a rigid plastic. That
      restricts motion and prevents your fingers from bending how they should.


      Don’t buy rigid tapes, they won’t work for you.
