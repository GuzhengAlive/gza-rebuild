          for an instrument sold in 2012. They have it mislabeled as a Chinese
          Guzheng... despite the Vietnamese maker's label. Used under Fair Use
          exception of US Copyright law.

      Next of the three instruments most often confused with the zheng is the
      Đàn tranh. There is some debate as to whether its lineage is a branch of
      the Song Dynasty-inspired Chinese zhengs or if the Đàn tranh led to the
      Song Dynasty zhengs or those popular in southern China.

      It's easiest to distinguish between modern long zithers but difficult to
      figure out the older ones. Modern đàn tranh have an opalescent styling
      which helps identify them today. If it's older than 100 years or doesn't
      feature this styling positive identification is more difficult.

      Đàn tranh feature metal strings, bridges that have generally thinner legs,
      and I've seen a number with DRMSL labeling by the strings, representing
      the Do Re Mi So La solfège renderings of the notes of pentatonic scales.

      Saadi which features plenty of footage and notes about this Vietnamese
      zither.
