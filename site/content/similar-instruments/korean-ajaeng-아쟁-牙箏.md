      Oh my lord, the Ajaeng! It's like the guzheng and the cello had a baby.
      It's amazing and I love it.


      \*ahem\*


      Said to be a take on the Chinese yazheng (also called yaqin), a long board
      zither played with a bow, the Ajaeng came about sometime during the Koryŏ
      dynasty (918–1392) (at least according to the [Encyclopedia
      Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/art/ajaeng)).


      I really can't say much more, other than please please please watch this
      video. It's magical.
