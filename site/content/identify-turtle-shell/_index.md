      Guzheng Alive is against using turtle shells for nails or picks. It is
      illegal in most parts of the world including the US, China, and Europe. It
      is, however, the single most iconic material and so has inspired many
      imitations. It can be hard to tell if a pick is made of turtle shell or
      not. Here are ways to identify what material your picks are made of.

    text: "This is a sample of turtle shell nails. Notice the way the colors blend together and transition from one color to another. The boundaries between colors are rough. Colors bleed in and through each other.\r\n\n\r\n\nClick on the image to zoom in."

    text: "These are man made. The patterning is created by mixing two colors of plastic or resin. Notice how you can identify discrete droplets with clean, smooth borders. This is not how turtle shell grows. Nails with this pattern are man-made. From GZA’s perspective that is a good thing! \r\n\n\r\n\nYou can see something similar if you conduct an experiment at home: place a droplet of pen ink into a shallow pan of water and watch how the ink behaves. At the very beginning you will see clear boundaries. Over time you’ll see the ink diffuse. That is what we see in 1c."

      These are man made, created by mixing two colors of plastic or resin. If
      the previous set of nails were the ‘before’ these are the ‘after’. The
      plastic sat so long in a liquid state that the colors turned the entire
      nail brown. The left thumb nail (bottom left) offers  great contrast. It
      was hardened earlier, like the set above, and does not show that general,
      light brown color.

    text: "Placing nails under direct light reveals clues to their makeup. Man made nails can reveal microcracks or a haze, almost as if they are covered in dust. \r\n\n\r\n\nMicrocracks are boundaries that formed as the material hardened. These are not always visible in man made nails, but if hazing is visible then those nails are guaranteed to be man-made.\n\n**NEEDS SECOND IMAGE**"

    text: "Get up close and personal with a set of man-made nails and you may see layering.\r\n\n\r\n\nQuite literally, layering is when one layer of liquid was set, cooled slightly, and then a second layer was poured on top. The difference in temperature and/or allowing one layer to partially harden prevents the layers from mixing. This can be repeated to add more layers.\r\n\n\r\n\nLook close at a set of nails and you may see how the colors of the nails are locked in layers, essentially spreading along a plane. Turtle shells grow in three dimensions; you would not see this obvious layering in actual turtle shell nails.\r\n\n\r\n\nNot all man-made nails have this but you can be sure no turtle shell nails do."
